This is a dataset of feature values and class labels for about 120,000 YouTube videos (instances). Each instance is described by up to 13 feature types, from 3 high level feature families: textual, visual, and auditory features. There are 31 class labels.

The dataset should be useful particularly for research on multiview (multimodal) learning, such as multiview clustering and/or supervised learning, co-training, early/late fusion, and ensemble techniques.

There is currently no code associated with this dataset.
